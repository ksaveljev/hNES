Attempting to write NES emulator

*** Current state ***
Unfortunately this is far from finished. I lost the interest in this project
during the PPU part. It requies good understanding of the internal workings in
order to make everything work, but for some reason I began to pay less and less
attention to the details in the docs and in the end I cannot write code to
something I do not understand. Oh well... maybe will pick it up again in the
future. Next step is to make both cpu and ppu run "simultaneously" (or well just
run CPU and make PPU catch up to it)
